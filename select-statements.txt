  > | greater than: Compares two values and returns the larger, like if you were trying to find all of the cats over a certain age.
  < | less than: Compares two values and find the lesser, like if you were trying to find all of the kittens under a certain weight.
  = | equal: Checks if two values are equivalent, like finding the exact name and title of a book.
  <= | less than or equal to: Compares two values equal to OR below a certain point, like finding all of the books publishing dates up to a certain year.
  >= | greater than or equal to: Compares two values equal to OR above a certain point, like finding all cats that are a certain age or older.

  <> | equivalent to '!=' above
  LIKE | checks if a string matches a pattern, like finding all cats with breeds that include 'Domestic'
  BETWEEN | checks if a value is between one AND another (same as >= __ AND <= __), like if a birds weight is BETWEEN 2 to 5 lbs.
